The easiest way to access and use the examples from the book is
through the {{ Atomic Kotlin EDU Course built into the special
version of JetBrains IDEA }}.

You can also compile, run, and test the examples using standalone tools on the
command line. The example source code can be found in the associated [Github
Repository](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples). The README for
that repository contains complete instructions for configuring and running the
code.
