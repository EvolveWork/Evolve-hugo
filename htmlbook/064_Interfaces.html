<blockquote>
<p>An <em>interface</em> specifies the actions that an object can do, without going into details about how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interface">Merriam-Webster</a> dictionary provides among others the following definition of the “interface” word: “The place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other”. This definition is quite helpful in understanding the goals of <code>interface</code>s in object-oriented programming: to provide a means of communication between different parts of the system.</p>
<p>In programming, the term <em>Application Programming Interface</em> (API) is often used in a general sense and refers to a set of clearly defined ways of communication between various software components. In object-oriented programming, an API of an object is a set of public members that it uses to interact with other objects in the application.</p>
<p>An interface represents a <em>concept</em> of a type. It says, “All classes that <em>implement</em> this interface will look this way.” It describes <em>what</em> a class should do, but not <em>how</em> it should do it. An interface provides a form, but generally no implementation. It describes the mission or a goal of an entity, while the class contains the implementation details.</p>
<p>Any code that uses a particular interface knows what methods might be called for that interface, and that’s all. The interface establishes a “protocol” between classes. (Some object-oriented programming languages have a keyword called <em>protocol</em> to do the same thing.)</p>
