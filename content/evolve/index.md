<p style="font-size:23px">111 Elk Ave 2nd Floor, Crested Butte, Colorado</p>

Join us in the heart of Crested Butte for a shared work experience. Located on
Elk Avenue in the midst of restaurants and coffee shops, with a balcony and
views of the avenue. We provide a quiet environment (headphones suggested) and
well-behaved dogs are welcome. There are two conference rooms, high-speed fiber
wireless, comfortable Aeron-style office chairs, desks and couches.

### We are only set up for monthly memberships (see below).

### Open Desks: $200/month

### Dedicated Desks: $300/month

### This is a self-managed workspace. There will be some organizational inconveniences as we develop ourselves.

### Please respect others in the space (See the note about Sound, below).

### Please lock the door when you leave if no one else is on your side.

### There will be some isolated periodic construction (mostly paint work) as I continue to improve the space.

## Monthly Memberships Only

Billing is month-to-month, per person. Our minimum is one month (The cost of
having a manager to take care of shorter times would not make sense). We do
have people that come in for shorter times but they still pay for a month.

This is a non-traditional co-working space and is predominantly self managed,
so we don't have a staff person to handle drop-ins. There are several coffee
shops in town that provide internet if that's all you need.

## Sound & Phone Use

An important part of coworking is being around other people and having
interesting conversations. We certainly want to encourage this, but in a way
that doesn't prevent focus when you need it.

If your job is nothing but taking and making phone calls or remote meetings,
it's not a good fit. Noise complaints are taken seriously. Disturbance is
something I want to be careful about, to make sure everyone has a good
experience.

Of course, people do need to sometimes have calls or remote meetings. The
primary concern is intrusiveness. We have people that do regular video
conferencing from their desks. This isn't intrusive because they wear headsets
and can be relatively quiet without impacting their meeting.

Headphones (noise-cancelling if you're sensitive) are a recommended addition to
your coworking kit. Not only will they exclude sound, they indicate to others
that you're "in the zone" and would prefer to be left alone. Even better is a
headset with a built-in microphone (I am a fan of Logitech headsets for quality
and price).

If you think a call will be intrusive, we have spaces that can be used for such
calls:

+ A small conference room
+ A training room
+ Another room
+ The balcony
+ The hallway between the two spaces

## Details

+ For security and safety, the space has recorded video surveilance.
+ Invoicing is automatic and you may set up automatic payments as well.

+ For internet security, we recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as
  <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton VPN</a>.
