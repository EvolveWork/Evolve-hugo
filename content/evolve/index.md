<p style="font-size:23px">111 Elk Ave 2nd Floor, Crested Butte, Colorado</p>

Join us for a shared work experience, right on Elk Avenue in the heart of
Crested Butte, in the midst of restaurants and coffee shops, with a balcony and
views of the avenue. We provide a quiet environment (headphones suggested) and
well-behaved dogs are welcome. There are two conference rooms, high-speed fiber
wireless, comfortable Aeron-style office chairs, desks and couches.

### Open Desks: $200/month

### Dedicated Desks: $300/month

### This is a self-managed workspace. There will be some organizational inconveniences as we develop ourselves.

### There will be some isolated periodic construction (mostly paint work) as I continue to improve the space.

### Sound & Phone Use

An important part of coworking is being around other people and having
interesting conversations. We certainly want to encourage this, but in a way
that doesn't prevent focus when you need it.

If your job is nothing but taking and making phone calls or remote meetings,
it's not a good fit.

Of course, people do need to sometimes have calls or remote meetings. The
primary concern is intrusiveness. We have people that do regular video
conferencing from their desks. This isn't intrusive because they wear headsets
and can be relatively quiet without impacting their meeting.

Headphones (noise-cancelling if you're sensitive) are an excellent addition to
your coworking kit. Not only will they exclude sound, they indicate to others
that you're "in the zone" and would prefer to be left alone. Even better is a
headset with a built-in microphone.

If you think a call will be intrusive, we have spaces that can be used for such
calls:

+ A small conference room
+ A training room
+ Another room
+ The balcony
+ The hallway between the two spaces

### Details

+ Monthly memberships only (I'm trying to minimize management overhead, so until I can figure out a hands-off way to do daily memberships, it's only monthly).
+ Memberships include 24/7 access via electronic locks connected to your smart phone.
+ Invoicing is automatic and you may set up automatic payments as well.
+ A contract, including a code of conduct, is coming.
+ For security and safety, the space has recorded video surveilance.
+ High-speed wireless via a fiber connection. 100 Mbs/s both ways, and we can increase the speed when
it becomes necessary. So far everyone is happy with the speed.
+ Well-behaved dogs are welcome.
+ Two separate spaces on the same floor.
+ Balcony overlooking Elk Avenue.
+ Two conference rooms. If no one has reserved them, you may work or make calls from these.
+ The balcony and connecting hallway can also be used to make calls.
